# Jupyter/Python + GitHub Actions Scraper

This is a quick demo of how to build a simple Python-based scraper, and automate it on a schedule using Github actions.

To get started with this on your computer:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Python and [pipenv](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/tool-recommendations/).
3. Run `pipenv install jupyterlab requests bs4`
4. Give it a test with `pipenv run jupyter execute scrape.ipynb`
5. Open up [cnr_headlines.csv](cnr_headlines.csv) to see the results.
6. Open the [scrape.ipynb](scrape.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook to see how everything works, and to edit.
